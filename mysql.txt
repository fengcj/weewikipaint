	> help START TRANSACTION
	
	  The WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT modifier starts a consistent read for
	  storage engines that are capable of it. This applies only to InnoDB.
	  The effect is the same as issuing a START TRANSACTION followed by a
	  SELECT from any InnoDB table. See
	  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/innodb-consistent-read.html.
	  The WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT modifier does not change the current
	  transaction isolation level, so it provides a consistent snapshot
	  only if the current isolation level is one that permits consistent
	  read (REPEATABLE READ or SERIALIZABLE).
